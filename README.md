Machine Learning Predictions Project

Project Overview:
This project utilizes machine learning to predict multiple features based on input data. The models are trained using data from the input_data.xlsx file, and the predictions are saved to predictions.xlsx.

Project Structure:

Prerequisites:
Before you begin, ensure you have the following packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- openpyxl
- joblib

You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow openpyxl joblib

Instructions:
1. Prepare the Input Data
   Ensure your input_data.xlsx file is correctly formatted with the necessary features and target columns.

2. Train the Models
   Run the train_model.py script to train models for each target feature:
   python train_model.py

3. Generate Predictions
   After training the models, run the generate_prediction.py script to generate predictions:
   python generate_prediction.py

4. View Results
   After running the prediction script, check the Results/predictions.xlsx file for the predictions generated by the models.

Output:
The predictions.xlsx file contains alternating rows of original and predicted values for the target features.

Notes:
- Update the input data as needed before re-running the training and prediction scripts.
- This project is designed to handle multiple target features by training a separate model for each feature.
